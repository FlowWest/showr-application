      <h1>About SHOWR</h1>
      <p>
        The SHO-WR application demonstrates the power of open data paired with open 
        source analytics and visualization tools for California water resources 
        management. The application  has been developed iteratively as part of a 
        demonstration project led by the Sacramento River Settlement Contractors 
        (SRSC). The primary objective of this demonstration project is to integrate 
        diverse flow, water operations, fishery, and water quality data into a 
        single, open data environment that facilitates more data-driven and timely 
        decision making. On the section of the Sacramento River immediately below 
        Lake Shasta, the fishery agencies have targeted water temperature as the 
        most critical resource to successful spawning of winter-run Chinook salmon 
        from late April through September.  This single parameter controls the 
        operation of Shasta Reservoir, SRSC diversions, the Central Valley 
        Project (CVP), other project reservoirs, and the Bay Delta.
